Predicting from the Hidden Layer of a Neural Network!!!???” It's weird, isn't it? Actually this is a very interesting idea; 
we have developed a new original autoencoder that allows hiding labels inside the hidden layer to predict from it later,
rather than the output layer in a completely unsupervised approximation. The idea applies to both numerical 
and categorical outputs (regression and classification). The question is ……. Why fro the hidden layer? 
Check the paper and find out the answer.
